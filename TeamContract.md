# Designated Roles

_List out roles in as much detail as possible. The more you figure out now, the more likely it is that the team will work together well. You should indicate who will be in charge of managing the team by arranging meetings, setting agendas, taking notes at meetings, and posting the meeting notes. You should describe how each member of the team will contribute to the design process and if/how various people are taking the lead. You should document a plan for who will be in charge of submitting the team assignments. Things like who will setup and maintain a code repository and issue tracker and who will be responsible for ensuring the app is thoroughly tested should also be described._

# Communication Methods

_Describe how your team will communicate, and especially how you will document that communication so others (meaning the teaching staff) can review it. Using text messages is not sufficient._

_Indicate the contact information for each member of the team (email and phone) and when it is ok to communicate (i.e., typical awake/working hours)._

# Coding

_Describe your teams plan for coding your prototype. Indicate the language you will use and the GUI frameworks. Include this statement:_

# Meeting Logistics

_You must have at least one regular weekly team meeting scheduled. This meeting cannot be set week-to-week, and should have a Zoom or Teams link associated with it so the teaching team can pop in. It is best if you can meet in person (at least at first), but it is acceptable to meet online if that what works for your team. Someone should take notes. You will likely need to meet more than once a week and so it would be good to specify other meeting times as well that will be backup times. Please include this statement:_

We agree to meet every \[Day of week\] at \[Time range\]. If team members agree, we will record the meeting. Regardless, we will provide a Zoom or Teams link and make it possible for the teaching team to pop in.

Our team documents will be stored \[where/using what platform\] and organized \[how organized\].

Beyond our weekly meeting above, other good backup times to meet will be \[List out the best options\].
